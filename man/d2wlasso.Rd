is multiplied by a scalar weight. Options include
\itemize{
  \item{one:}{The scalar weight is one.}

  groups by first ordering the ridge regression coefficients in descending order
  and splitting them into \code{k.split} groups. We then applied a stepwise linear/Cox regression of the response on each partition
  set of covariate. The final model is selected using an AIC criterion, and we track if \eqn{x_j} is
  excluded from the final model. We repeat
  this procedure \code{nboot} times and the exclusion frequency is the average number of times
  \eqn{x_j} is excluded.}

\description{
This package provides functions to perform variable selection with weighted lasso for both linear regression
and the Cox proportional hazards regression. The weights are chosen to direct the variable selection procedure so that covariates that are highly
associated with the response are likely to be selected and covariates that weakly associated with the response
are less likely to be selected.  Association between the response and the covariates is based on
results from simpler linear/Cox regressions between the response and each covariate, and include, for example,
q-values, partial correlation coefficients, and t-statistics of regression coefficients.

Performs variable selection with covariates multiplied by weights that direct which variables
are likely to be associated with the response.
