\title{Correlation, p-value and t-statistic associated with the regression between response y and a covariate x
after potential adjustment for a covariate z.}
\usage{
correlations(
  factor.z,
  x,
  z,
  response,
  partial = FALSE,
  ttest.pvalue = FALSE,
  regression.type
)
}
\arguments{
\item{factor.z}{logical. If TRUE, the fixed variable z is a factor variable.}

\item{x}{(n by m) matrix of main covariates where m is the number of covariates and n is the sample size.}

\item{z}{(n by 1) matrix of additional fixed covariate affecting response variable. Can be NULL.}

\item{response}{a list containing: yy and delta. yy is an (n by 1) matrix corresponding to the response variable. If \code{regression.type} is "cox",
\code{y} contains the observed event times. delta is an (n by 1) matrix that denotes censoring when \code{regression.type} is "cox" (1 denotes
survival event is observed, 0 denotes the survival event is censored). Can be NULL.}

\item{partial}{logical indicator. If TRUE, the partial correlation is computed between the response
and each covariate in x after adjustment for z. If FALSE, the correlation is computed between the
response and each covariate in x.}

\item{ttest.pvalue}{logical indicator. If TRUE, p-value for each covariate is computed from univariate
linear/cox regression of the response on each covariate. If FALSE, the
p-value is computed from correlation coefficients between the response and each covariate.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{regression.type}{a character indicator that is either "linear" for linear regression
or "cox" for Cox proportional hazards regression. Default is "linear".}
}
\value{
\itemize{
  \item \strong{pvalues:}{p-values for each x_k in the regression of y on x_k when \code{partial}=FALSE. Otherwise,
  p-values for each x_k in the regression of y on x_k and z when \code{partial}=TRUE.}
  \item \strong{estimate:}{Correlation between x_k and y when \code{partial}=FALSE.
  Otherwise, \code{estimate} is the partial correlation between x_k and y after adjustment for z
  when \code{partial} is TRUE.}
  \item \strong{tvalues:}{t-statistic with testing the significance of x_k in the regression
  of y on x_k and z when \code{partial} is TRUE. Otherwise it is the t-statistic when testing the
  significance of x_k in the regression of y on x_k when \code{partial} is FALSE.}
